Ben's Checkers Server Library
=================================

This library is used for creating Ben's Checkers servers. 
It will manage players, configuration, and mods for you 
while still allowing full control over the backend.

For new players looking to set up a server quick, fast, 
and without code, this is not the repository for you.
You should see the "Checkers Basic Server" link below.

=================================
Checkers Basic Server: [COMING SOON]
	Basic Server provides a complete server setup that
	will act as a standard Checkers Server. It does not
	contain any mod packs and is just classic checkers.

Server Library: https://github.com/bcheckers/server
	This .DLL can be imported into a C# File to build
	your own server from the ground up. It contains
	all the necessary components to manage the server,
	and lets you manage your own mods, rulesets, and more.
